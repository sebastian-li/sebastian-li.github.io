      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common pediatric brain tumor. PA has at least a 50% higher incidence in populations of European ancestry compared to other ancestral groups, which may be due in part to genetic differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first compared the global proportions of European, African, and Amerindian ancestries in 301 PA cases and 1185 controls of self-identified Latino ethnicity from the California Biobank. We then conducted admixture mapping analysis to assess PA risk with local ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found PA cases had a significantly higher proportion of global European ancestry than controls (case median = 0.55, control median = 0.51, P value = 3.5x10-3). Admixture mapping identified 13 SNPs in the 6q14.3 region (SNX14) contributing to risk, as well as three other peaks approaching significance on chromosomes 7, 10 and 13. Downstream fine mapping in these regions revealed several SNPs potentially contributing to childhood PA risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a significant difference in genomic ancestry associated with Latino PA risk and several genomic loci potentially mediating this risk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigenome-Wide Association Study of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children with Down Syndrome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS) is caused by constitutional trisomy of chromosome 21 and is associated with an up to 30-fold increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While DS is associated with alterations in epigenetic markers, including DNA methylation, and gene expression. These mechanisms have not been fully explored in relation to DS-ALL etiology. Because the epigenome is sensitive to genetic and environmental influences during fetal development and can be leveraged to characterize blood cell proportions, we sought to evaluate the role of the neonatal methylome in children with DS on subsequent ALL risk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mitochondrial 1555 G&gt;A Variant as a Potential Risk Factor for Childhood Glioblastoma</title>
      <link>https://sebastian-li.github.io/publication/mitochondrial-1555-ga-variant-as-a-potential-risk-factor-for-childhood-glioblastoma/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Background:
Childhood glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive disease with low survival, and its etiology, especially concerning germline genetic risk, is poorly understood. Mitochondria play a key role in putative tumorigenic processes relating to cellular oxidative metabolism, and mitochondrial DNA variants were not previously assessed for association with pediatric brain tumor risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods:
We conducted an analysis of 675 mitochondrial DNA variants in 90 childhood GBM cases and 2,789 controls to identify enrichment of mitochondrial variant associated with GBM risk. We also performed this analysis for other glioma subtypes including pilocytic astrocytoma. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene variants were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results:
We identified m1555 A&amp;gt;G was significantly associated with GBM risk (adjusted OR 29.30, 95% CI 5.25-163.4, P value 9.5X10 -4). No association was detected for other subtypes. Haplotype analysis further supported the independent risk contributed by m1555 G&amp;gt;A, instead of a haplogroup joint effect. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene variants identified significant associations in European (rs62036057 in WWOX, adjusted OR = 2.99, 95% CI 1.88-4.75, P value = 3.42X10 -6) and Hispanic (rs111709726 in EFHD1, adjusted OR = 3.57, 95% CI 1.99-6.40, P value = 1.41X10 -6) populations in ethnicity-stratified analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:
We report for the first time a potential role played by a functional mitochondrial ribosomal RNA variant in childhood GBM risk, and a potential role for both mitochondrial and nuclear-mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms in GBM tumorigenesis. These data implicate cellular oxidative metabolic capacity as a contributor to the etiology of pediatric glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Application of CT-based radiomics in predicting portal pressure and patient outcome in portal hypertension</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purpose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portal venous pressure (PVP) measurement is of clinical significance, especially in patients with portal hypertension. However, the invasive nature and associated complications limits its application. The aim of the study is to propose a noninvasive predictive model of PVP values based on CT-extracted radiomic features.
Methods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiomics PVP (rPVP) models based on liver, spleen and combined features were established on an experimental cohort of 169 subjects. Radiomics features were extracted from each ROI and reduced via the LASSO regression to achieve an optimal predictive formula. A validation cohort of 62 patients treated for gastroesophageal varices (GOV) was used to confirm the utility of rPVP in predicting variceal recurrence. The association between rPVP and response to treatment was observed.
Results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three separate predictive formula for PVP were derived from radiomics features. rPVP was significantly correlated to patient response to endoscopic treatment for GOV. Among which, the model containing both liver and spleen features has the highest predictability of variceal recurrence, with an optimal cut-off value at 29.102â€¯mmHg (AUC 0.866). A Kaplan Meier analysis further confirmed the difference between patients with varying rPVP values.
Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PVP values can be accurately predicted by a non-invasive, CT derived radiomics model. rPVP serves as a non-invasive and precise reference for predicting treatment outcome for GOV secondary to portal hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;
