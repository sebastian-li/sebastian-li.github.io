      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerated aging is a hallmark of Down syndrome (DS), with adults experiencing early-onset Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease and premature aging of the skin, hair, and immune and endocrine systems. Accelerated epigenetic aging has been found in the blood and brain tissue of adults with DS but when premature aging in DS begins remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether accelerated aging in DS is already detectable in blood at birth. We assessed the association between age acceleration and DS using five epigenetic clocks in 346 newborns with DS and 567 newborns without DS using Illumina MethylationEPIC DNA methylation array data. We compared two epigenetic aging clocks (DNAmSkinBloodClock and pan-tissue DNAmAge) and three epigenetic gestational age clocks (Haftorn, Knight, and Bohlin) between DS and non-DS newborns using linear regression adjusting for observed age, sex, batch, deconvoluted blood cell proportions, and genetic ancestry. Targeted sequencing of GATA1 was performed in a subset of 184 newborns with DS to identify somatic mutations associated with transient abnormal myelopoiesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DS was significantly associated with increased DNAmSkinBloodClock (effect estimate = 0.2442, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), with an epigenetic age acceleration of 244 days in newborns with DS after adjusting for potential confounding factors (95% confidence interval: 196–292 days). We also found evidence of epigenetic age acceleration associated with somatic GATA1 mutations among newborns with DS (p = 0.015). DS was not associated with epigenetic gestational age acceleration. We demonstrate that accelerated epigenetic aging in the blood of DS patients begins prenatally, with implications for the pathophysiology of immunosenescence and other aging-related traits in DS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS) is caused by constitutional trisomy of chromosome 21 and is associated with an up to 30-fold increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While DS is associated with alterations in epigenetic markers, including DNA methylation, and gene expression. These mechanisms have not been fully explored in relation to DS-ALL etiology. Because the epigenome is sensitive to genetic and environmental influences during fetal development and can be leveraged to characterize blood cell proportions, we sought to evaluate the role of the neonatal methylome in children with DS on subsequent ALL risk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children is associated with a distinct neonatalcytokine profile. The basis of this neonatal immune phenotype is unknown, but potentially related to maternal-fetal immune receptor interactions. We conducted a case-control study of 226 case child-mother pairs and 404 control child-mother pairs to evaluate the role of interaction between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes in the offspring and maternal killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotypes in the etiology of childhood ALL, while considering potential mediation by neonatal cytokines and the immune-modulating enzyme arginase-II (ARG-II). We observed different associations between offspring HLA-maternal KIR activating profiles and the risk of ALL in different predicted genetic ancestry groups. For instance, in Latino subjects who experience the highest risk of childhood leukemia, activating profiles were significantly associated with a lower risk of childhood ALL (odds ratio, OR=0.59; 95% confidence interval, CI:0.49, 0.71) and a higher level of ARG-II at birth (coefficient=0.13; 95%CI:0.04, 0.22). HLA-KIR activating profiles were also associated with a lower risk of ALL in non-Latino Asians (OR=0.63; 95%CI:0.38, 1.01), however with lower TNF-􏰀 level (coefficient=-0.27; 95%CI:-0.49, -0.06). Among non-Latino White subjects, no significant association was observed between offspring HLA-maternal KIR interaction and ALL risk, or cytokine levels. The current study reports the association between offspring HLA-maternal KIR interaction and the development of childhood ALL with variation by predicted genetic ancestry. We also observed some associations between activating profiles and immune factors related to cytokine control; however, cytokines did not demonstrate causal mediation of the activating profiles on ALL risk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Down syndrome (DS) is associated with an up to 30-fold increased risk of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and DS-ALL patients have worse overall survival and increased long-term treatment-related health conditions compared with non-DS ALL patients. In a recent genome-wide association study of DS-ALL, established ALL genetic risk loci were associated with DS-ALL, with several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) conferring a larger effect on ALL risk in the context of DS than in euploidy. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to elucidate whether epigenetic differences at birth are associated with risk of subsequent DS-ALL.
Methods: The DS-ALL Discovery Study included 147 DS-ALL cases and 198 DS controls from the International Study of Down Syndrome Acute Leukemia, with newborn dried bloodspots (DBS) obtained from California (n=326) and Washington state (n=19) biobanks. The DS-ALL Replication Study included 24 DS-ALL cases and 24 DS controls with newborn DBS from the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. DNA was isolated from DBS, bisulfite converted, and assayed using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip genome-wide DNA methylation arrays. Raw data were processed using “minfi” and “noob” packages in R. Reference-based deconvolution of blood cell proportions was performed using the Identifying Optimal DNA methylation Libraries (IDOL) algorithm, using DNA methylation data from cord blood reference samples, to estimate proportions of B cells, T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), monocytes, granulocytes, natural killer cells, and nucleated red blood cells. We compared each cell type proportion between DS-ALL cases and DS controls using linear regression adjusting for sex, plate, and principal components (PCs) to account for genetic ancestry. To identify single CpG probes associated with DS-ALL risk, we performed a multiethnic EWAS of DS-ALL in each study using linear regression adjusting for sex, plate, and PCs related to: 1) cell-type proportions and 2) genetic ancestry. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using DMRcate and comb-p methods. In the Discovery Study, genome-wide SNP array data were available for 131 cases and 130 controls, and data from targeted sequencing of somatic mutations in exons 2/3 of GATA1 were available for 184/198 DS controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: Deconvolution of blood cell proportions in the DS-ALL Discovery Study showed significantly higher B cell proportions in newborns with DS who later developed ALL (mean=0.0128, sd=0.0151) compared with DS controls (mean=0.00826, sd=0.0115) (P=6.4x10-4, coefficient=0.0052). A significantly higher B cell proportion at birth was also found in DS-ALL cases in the independent Replication Study (cases mean=0.048, sd=0.024; controls mean=0.039, sd=0.028; P=0.03, coefficient=0.015). In the Discovery Study, the B cell difference remained significant (P=5.8x10-3) with a similar effect size (coefficient=0.0045) after removal of GATA1 mutation-positive DS controls (n=30). We also investigated whether DS-ALL risk SNPs at ARID5B, IKZF1, GATA3, and CDKN2A may confound the association, but the increased B cell proportions in DS-ALL remained significant and effect estimates slightly increased in SNP genotype-adjusted models (coefficient range:0.0055-0.0059). In the EWAS of DS-ALL, 9 CpGs reached epigenome-wide significance (P&amp;lt;7.67x10-8), including 2 CpGs overlapping the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene TRIM13, frequently deleted in B-CLL, although none of these showed evidence of association (P&amp;lt;0.05) in the Replication Study. We identified 125 DMRs associated with DS-ALL in the Discovery Study. For 3 DMRs, overlapping genes HOPX, SMIM24, and PPP1R10, all implicated in normal and leukemic stem cell function, there were multiple significant CpGs in the Replication Study (P&amp;lt;0.05) all with effects in the same direction as the Discovery Study DMRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Increased B cell proportions in newborns with DS may be a risk factor for development of DS-ALL in childhood. This finding, based on DNA methylation data, requires confirmation using conventional cell count measures, and should be explored as a novel biomarker for ALL risk in the non-DS population. Single CpGs and DMRs associated with DS-ALL risk in our Discovery Study require further investigation, including in additional ALL case-control studies in DS and non-DS populations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We performed a trans-ethnic GWAS of childhood ALL in a discovery panel of 76,317 individuals, including 3482 cases and 72,835 controls distributed across four ethnic cohorts (African Americans, AFR; East Asian Americans, EAS; Latino Americans, LAT; Non-Latino White Americans, NLW; Supplemen- tary Information). After quality control filtering, our dataset consisted of 124, 318, 1878, 1162 cases and 2067, 5017, 8410, 57,341 controls in AFR, EAS, LAT, and NLW, respectively. Furthermore, we tested the association at 7,628,894 imputed SNPs, including low frequency (minor allele frequency, MAF, between 1–5%) variants that were not previously systematically tested. We aggregated summary statistics across the four ethnic groups in a fixed-effect meta- analysis. The genomic control inflation factor was 1.022 after excluding 16 previously reported ALL-associated loci, suggesting our meta-analysis was reasonably robust to any confounding due to population stratification.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down syndrome is associated with genome-wide perturbation of gene expression, which may be mediated by epigenetic changes. We perform an epigenome-wide association study on neonatal bloodspots comparing 196 newborns with Down syndrome and 439 newborns without Down syndrome, adjusting for cell-type heterogeneity, which identifies 652 epigenome-wide significant CpGs (P &amp;lt; 7.67 × 10−8) and 1,052 differentially methylated regions. Differential methylation at promoter/enhancer regions correlates with gene expression changes in Down syndrome versus non-Down syndrome fetal liver hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (P &amp;lt; 0.0001). The top two differentially methylated regions overlap RUNX1 and FLI1, both important regulators of megakaryopoiesis and hematopoietic development, with significant hypermethylation at promoter regions of these two genes. Excluding Down syndrome newborns harboring preleukemic GATA1 mutations (N = 30), identified by targeted sequencing, has minimal impact on the epigenome-wide association study results. Down syndrome has profound, genome-wide effects on DNA methylation in hematopoietic cells in early life, which may contribute to the high frequency of hematological problems, including leukemia, in children with Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
