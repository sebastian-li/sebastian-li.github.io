      <description>&lt;p&gt;Background:
Childhood glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive disease with low survival, and its etiology, especially concerning germline genetic risk, is poorly understood. Mitochondria play a key role in putative tumorigenic processes relating to cellular oxidative metabolism, and mitochondrial DNA variants were not previously assessed for association with pediatric brain tumor risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods:
We conducted an analysis of 675 mitochondrial DNA variants in 90 childhood GBM cases and 2,789 controls to identify enrichment of mitochondrial variant associated with GBM risk. We also performed this analysis for other glioma subtypes including pilocytic astrocytoma. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene variants were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results:
We identified m1555 A&amp;gt;G was significantly associated with GBM risk (adjusted OR 29.30, 95% CI 5.25-163.4, P value 9.5X10 -4). No association was detected for other subtypes. Haplotype analysis further supported the independent risk contributed by m1555 G&amp;gt;A, instead of a haplogroup joint effect. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene variants identified significant associations in European (rs62036057 in WWOX, adjusted OR = 2.99, 95% CI 1.88-4.75, P value = 3.42X10 -6) and Hispanic (rs111709726 in EFHD1, adjusted OR = 3.57, 95% CI 1.99-6.40, P value = 1.41X10 -6) populations in ethnicity-stratified analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:
We report for the first time a potential role played by a functional mitochondrial ribosomal RNA variant in childhood GBM risk, and a potential role for both mitochondrial and nuclear-mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms in GBM tumorigenesis. These data implicate cellular oxidative metabolic capacity as a contributor to the etiology of pediatric glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clinical characteristics of cytomegalovirus-positive pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections and antigenic exposures during childhood are associated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are thought to lead to immune dysregulation stimulating pre-leukemic clones to expand and progress to overt leukemia. Emerging epidemiologic and laboratory evidence suggests cytomegalovirus (CMV) may contribute to the development of childhood ALL inspiring further investigative efforts and for the first time, identifying a specific target for ALL prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we aimed to better elucidate the role of CMV in ALL etiology by screening diagnostic leukemia bone marrow samples for CMV DNA using a highly quantitative droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified differences in demographic features and leukemia subtypes between CMV-positive and CMV-negative cases, supporting the hypothesis that CMV plays a role in ALL development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A genome-wide association analysis of childhood glioma and assessment of the contribution of enhanced European genetic risk via admixture analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioma is the most common brain tumor in children, comprising almost half of all pediatric central nervous system tumors. The biologic and histologic heterogeneity of pediatric glioma makes its treatment highly challenging. The incidence of glioma varies significantly by ethnicity, with higher rates observed in European populations, suggestive of genetic contributions. While the majority of gliomas are curable, high-grade malignant cases have poor survival rates, underscoring the importance of research in this common tumor affecting children. We aimed to identify genetic variants that are associated with childhood glioma and determine whether European genetic ancestry contributes to enhanced childhood glioma risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants that are significantly associated with childhood glioma risk in a multi-ethnic California birth cohort (1982-2011). Study subjects included 3141 glioma cases (age 0-14 at diagnosis) and 3167 cancer-free controls matched by birth year, with additional 2913 controls from the 1000 Genomes Project and Human Genome Diversity Project. In subjects with pilocytic glioma, we also estimated the proportions of European, African and Native American ancestry proportions among admixed Hispanic subjects and tested whether genome wide European ancestry proportion is associated with risk. Regional admixture mapping and conditional analyses were performed to identify associations with local ancestral haplotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta-analysis of GWAS in all ethnicities identified strong and significant hits in a specific noncoding RNA in chromosome 10. Global ancestry analysis demonstrated that a higher European ancestral background contributes to elevated childhood pilocytic astrocytoma risk (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P value = 0.003475). Regional admixture mapping revealed a locus in chromosome 6 (P value = 4.70Ã—10^(-6)) as the most significant regional ancestry loci associated with pilocytic glioma risk, with additional contributions from other loci around the genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discover for the first time the genetic variants that are associated with childhood glioma risk, and captured the ancestral difference in glioma risk both globally and regionally. This latter analysis partly explains the demonstrated higher incidence and familial relative risk of low grade glioma in Europeans when compared to groups of other ancestral origins.&lt;/p&gt;
