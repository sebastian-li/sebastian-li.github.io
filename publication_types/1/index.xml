      <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Down syndrome (DS) is associated with an up to 30-fold increased risk of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and DS-ALL patients have worse overall survival and increased long-term treatment-related health conditions compared with non-DS ALL patients. In a recent genome-wide association study of DS-ALL, established ALL genetic risk loci were associated with DS-ALL, with several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) conferring a larger effect on ALL risk in the context of DS than in euploidy. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to elucidate whether epigenetic differences at birth are associated with risk of subsequent DS-ALL.
Methods: The DS-ALL Discovery Study included 147 DS-ALL cases and 198 DS controls from the International Study of Down Syndrome Acute Leukemia, with newborn dried bloodspots (DBS) obtained from California (n=326) and Washington state (n=19) biobanks. The DS-ALL Replication Study included 24 DS-ALL cases and 24 DS controls with newborn DBS from the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. DNA was isolated from DBS, bisulfite converted, and assayed using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip genome-wide DNA methylation arrays. Raw data were processed using “minfi” and “noob” packages in R. Reference-based deconvolution of blood cell proportions was performed using the Identifying Optimal DNA methylation Libraries (IDOL) algorithm, using DNA methylation data from cord blood reference samples, to estimate proportions of B cells, T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), monocytes, granulocytes, natural killer cells, and nucleated red blood cells. We compared each cell type proportion between DS-ALL cases and DS controls using linear regression adjusting for sex, plate, and principal components (PCs) to account for genetic ancestry. To identify single CpG probes associated with DS-ALL risk, we performed a multiethnic EWAS of DS-ALL in each study using linear regression adjusting for sex, plate, and PCs related to: 1) cell-type proportions and 2) genetic ancestry. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using DMRcate and comb-p methods. In the Discovery Study, genome-wide SNP array data were available for 131 cases and 130 controls, and data from targeted sequencing of somatic mutations in exons 2/3 of GATA1 were available for 184/198 DS controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: Deconvolution of blood cell proportions in the DS-ALL Discovery Study showed significantly higher B cell proportions in newborns with DS who later developed ALL (mean=0.0128, sd=0.0151) compared with DS controls (mean=0.00826, sd=0.0115) (P=6.4x10-4, coefficient=0.0052). A significantly higher B cell proportion at birth was also found in DS-ALL cases in the independent Replication Study (cases mean=0.048, sd=0.024; controls mean=0.039, sd=0.028; P=0.03, coefficient=0.015). In the Discovery Study, the B cell difference remained significant (P=5.8x10-3) with a similar effect size (coefficient=0.0045) after removal of GATA1 mutation-positive DS controls (n=30). We also investigated whether DS-ALL risk SNPs at ARID5B, IKZF1, GATA3, and CDKN2A may confound the association, but the increased B cell proportions in DS-ALL remained significant and effect estimates slightly increased in SNP genotype-adjusted models (coefficient range:0.0055-0.0059). In the EWAS of DS-ALL, 9 CpGs reached epigenome-wide significance (P&amp;lt;7.67x10-8), including 2 CpGs overlapping the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene TRIM13, frequently deleted in B-CLL, although none of these showed evidence of association (P&amp;lt;0.05) in the Replication Study. We identified 125 DMRs associated with DS-ALL in the Discovery Study. For 3 DMRs, overlapping genes HOPX, SMIM24, and PPP1R10, all implicated in normal and leukemic stem cell function, there were multiple significant CpGs in the Replication Study (P&amp;lt;0.05) all with effects in the same direction as the Discovery Study DMRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Increased B cell proportions in newborns with DS may be a risk factor for development of DS-ALL in childhood. This finding, based on DNA methylation data, requires confirmation using conventional cell count measures, and should be explored as a novel biomarker for ALL risk in the non-DS population. Single CpGs and DMRs associated with DS-ALL risk in our Discovery Study require further investigation, including in additional ALL case-control studies in DS and non-DS populations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A genome-wide association analysis of childhood glioma and assessment of the contribution of enhanced European genetic risk via admixture analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioma is the most common brain tumor in children, comprising almost half of all pediatric central nervous system tumors. The biologic and histologic heterogeneity of pediatric glioma makes its treatment highly challenging. The incidence of glioma varies significantly by ethnicity, with higher rates observed in European populations, suggestive of genetic contributions. While the majority of gliomas are curable, high-grade malignant cases have poor survival rates, underscoring the importance of research in this common tumor affecting children. We aimed to identify genetic variants that are associated with childhood glioma and determine whether European genetic ancestry contributes to enhanced childhood glioma risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants that are significantly associated with childhood glioma risk in a multi-ethnic California birth cohort (1982-2011). Study subjects included 3141 glioma cases (age 0-14 at diagnosis) and 3167 cancer-free controls matched by birth year, with additional 2913 controls from the 1000 Genomes Project and Human Genome Diversity Project. In subjects with pilocytic glioma, we also estimated the proportions of European, African and Native American ancestry proportions among admixed Hispanic subjects and tested whether genome wide European ancestry proportion is associated with risk. Regional admixture mapping and conditional analyses were performed to identify associations with local ancestral haplotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta-analysis of GWAS in all ethnicities identified strong and significant hits in a specific noncoding RNA in chromosome 10. Global ancestry analysis demonstrated that a higher European ancestral background contributes to elevated childhood pilocytic astrocytoma risk (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P value = 0.003475). Regional admixture mapping revealed a locus in chromosome 6 (P value = 4.70×10^(-6)) as the most significant regional ancestry loci associated with pilocytic glioma risk, with additional contributions from other loci around the genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discover for the first time the genetic variants that are associated with childhood glioma risk, and captured the ancestral difference in glioma risk both globally and regionally. This latter analysis partly explains the demonstrated higher incidence and familial relative risk of low grade glioma in Europeans when compared to groups of other ancestral origins.&lt;/p&gt;
