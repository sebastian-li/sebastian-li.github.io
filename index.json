In a recent genome-wide association study of DS-ALL, established ALL genetic risk loci were associated with DS-ALL, with several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) conferring a larger effect on ALL risk in the context of DS than in euploidy. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to elucidate whether epigenetic differences at birth are associated with risk of subsequent DS-ALL. Methods: The DS-ALL Discovery Study included 147 DS-ALL cases and 198 DS controls from the International Study of Down Syndrome Acute Leukemia, with newborn dried bloodspots (DBS) obtained from California (n=326) and Washington state (n=19) biobanks. The DS-ALL Replication Study included 24 DS-ALL cases and 24 DS controls with newborn DBS from the Michigan Neonatal Biobank. DNA was isolated from DBS, bisulfite converted, and assayed using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip genome-wide DNA methylation arrays. Raw data were processed using “minfi” and “noob” packages in R. Reference-based deconvolution of blood cell proportions was performed using the Identifying Optimal DNA methylation Libraries (IDOL) algorithm, using DNA methylation data from cord blood reference samples, to estimate proportions of B cells, T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), monocytes, granulocytes, natural killer cells, and nucleated red blood cells. We compared each cell type proportion between DS-ALL cases and DS controls using linear regression adjusting for sex, plate, and principal components (PCs) to account for genetic ancestry. To identify single CpG probes associated with DS-ALL risk, we performed a multiethnic EWAS of DS-ALL in each study using linear regression adjusting for sex, plate, and PCs related to: 1) cell-type proportions and 2) genetic ancestry. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using DMRcate and comb-p methods. In the Discovery Study, genome-wide SNP array data were available for 131 cases and 130 controls, and data from targeted sequencing of somatic mutations in exons 2/3 of GATA1 were available for 184/198 DS controls.\nResults: Deconvolution of blood cell proportions in the DS-ALL Discovery Study showed significantly higher B cell proportions in newborns with DS who later developed ALL (mean=0.0128, sd=0.0151) compared with DS controls (mean=0.00826, sd=0.0115) (P=6.4x10-4, coefficient=0.0052). A significantly higher B cell proportion at birth was also found in DS-ALL cases in the independent Replication Study (cases mean=0.048, sd=0.024; controls mean=0.039, sd=0.028; P=0.03, coefficient=0.015). In the Discovery Study, the B cell difference remained significant (P=5.8x10-3) with a similar effect size (coefficient=0.0045) after removal of GATA1 mutation-positive DS controls (n=30). We also investigated whether DS-ALL risk SNPs at ARID5B, IKZF1, GATA3, and CDKN2A may confound the association, but the increased B cell proportions in DS-ALL remained significant and effect estimates slightly increased in SNP genotype-adjusted models (coefficient range:0.0055-0.0059). In the EWAS of DS-ALL, 9 CpGs reached epigenome-wide significance (P\u0026lt;7.67x10-8), including 2 CpGs overlapping the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene TRIM13, frequently deleted in B-CLL, although none of these showed evidence of association (P\u0026lt;0.05) in the Replication Study. We identified 125 DMRs associated with DS-ALL in the Discovery Study. For 3 DMRs, overlapping genes HOPX, SMIM24, and PPP1R10, all implicated in normal and leukemic stem cell function, there were multiple significant CpGs in the Replication Study (P\u0026lt;0.05) all with effects in the same direction as the Discovery Study DMRs.\nConclusions: Increased B cell proportions in newborns with DS may be a risk factor for development of DS-ALL in childhood. This finding, based on DNA methylation data, requires confirmation using conventional cell count measures, and should be explored as a novel biomarker for ALL risk in the non-DS population. Single CpGs and DMRs associated with DS-ALL risk in our Discovery Study require further investigation, including in additional ALL case-control studies in DS and non-DS populations.\n","date":1639180800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639180800,"objectID":"18984986ddeed3e0c69289c21b4ec9df","permalink":"https://sebastian-li.github.io/publication/epigenome-wide-association-study-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-with-down-syndrome/","publishdate":"2021-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/epigenome-wide-association-study-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-with-down-syndrome/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Down syndrome (DS) is associated with an up to 30-fold increased risk of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and DS-ALL patients have worse overall survival and increased long-term treatment-related health conditions compared with non-DS ALL patients.

AGR was defined as the ratio of serum albumin to nonalbumins (serum total protein-albumin). The association of preoperative AGR with clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis were assessed. Multivariate analyses using Cox regression models were applied to evaluate the independent prognostic factors.\nResults: The receiver operating curve analysis indicated 1.55 as the optimal cutoff value to define low or high AGR. In prematched cohorts, Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that AGR lower than 1.55 was associated with poorer overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and tumor-specific survival (TSS) (P \u0026lt; 0.001 for all). Multivariable cox analyses also showed that AGR lower than 1.55 were an independent risk factor for survival outcomes, including OS, PFS, and TSS (P \u0026lt; 0.01 for all). In particular, AGR lower than 1.55 remained its prognostic value after PSM analysis.\nConclusion: Low AGR was a significant unfavorable factor for UCB patients treated with radical cystectomy. This viable parameter should be enrolled in the pretreatment risk stratification for UCB.\n","date":1513123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513123200,"objectID":"c8025dd65498c245c50e29f8b043141b","permalink":"https://sebastian-li.github.io/publication/the-prognostic-value-of-preoperative-serum-albumin-globulin-ratio-for-high-grade-bladder-urothelial-carcinoma-treated-with-radical-cystectomy-a-propensity-score-matched-analysis/","publishdate":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/the-prognostic-value-of-preoperative-serum-albumin-globulin-ratio-for-high-grade-bladder-urothelial-carcinoma-treated-with-radical-cystectomy-a-propensity-score-matched-analysis/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract\nObjectives: Albumin-globulin ratio (AGR) has been reported as an independent risk factor for survival outcomes of a variety of malignancies.

We aim to investigate the expression of CPEB4 and its prognostic significance in invasive ductal breast carcinoma.\nMethods Immunohistochemical staining of CPEB4 and estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor was performed in 107 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) samples, and prognostic significance was evaluated.\nResults High expression of CPEB4 was observed in 48.6% of IDC samples. Elevated CPEB4 expression was possibly related to increased histological grading (P=0.037) and N stage (P\u0026lt;0.001). Patients with high expression of CPEB4 showed shorter overall survival (P=0.001). High CPEB4 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P=0.022, hazard ratio =4.344, 95% confidence interval =1.235–15.283).\nConclusion High CPEB4 expression is associated with increased histological grading and N stage, and it can serve as an independent prognostic factor in IDC.\nKeywords: cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4, invasive ductal carcinoma, immunohistochemistry, prognosis\n","date":1448496000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448496000,"objectID":"b084c4d237b39003ea3124a082612a0e","permalink":"https://sebastian-li.github.io/publication/expression-of-cpeb4-in-invasive-ductal-breast-carcinoma-and-its-prognostic-significance/","publishdate":"2015-11-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/expression-of-cpeb4-in-invasive-ductal-breast-carcinoma-and-its-prognostic-significance/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract\nAims Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins (CPEBs) are RNA-binding proteins that regulate translation by inducing cytoplasmic polyadenylation.
